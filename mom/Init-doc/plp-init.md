## 1. Vision: Fluid Intelligence as a Platform Core
### Key Discussion Points
- Intelligence as ability to distinguish, connect, reason, judge, and apply.
- Learning flow: Word → Meaning → Understanding → Reasoning → Judgment → Decision → Skill → Problem Solving.
- Language as the core primitive of intelligence.
- Iterative accuracy improvement (70% → 95%).

### Action Items
- Define a formal Fluid Intelligence model.
- Create a 1-page conceptual vision document.
- Extract core intelligence primitives.
- Convert examples into system analogies.

## 2. Problem Statement
### Key Discussion Points
- Traditional workflows are rigid.
- Users don’t fully understand problems initially.
- Systems must evolve with feedback.

### Action Items
- Write problem definition MD.
- Define target users and pain points.
- Establish success metrics.

---
